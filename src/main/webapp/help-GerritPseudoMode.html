Check if this server works on pseudo mode.

This mode allows this server to start without Gerrit connection. It means that this server can be used to accept Gerrit events come from other plugins.

In this mode, all Gerrit connection settings except E-mail are ignored.

Note that you cannot set this mode while connection is established.
